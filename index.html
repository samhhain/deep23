      <h3>Basic Bit Blog</h3>        
      <p>I am trying to find a use for this site here on the deep web.</p>
      <p>So far, this exercise has only been about the code to create it, so the content, isn't that interesting.</p>
      <p>I don't mind</p>
      <p>This page is for me and my web enjoyment.</p>
      <p>This has worked though, yesterday I drove 16 miles listening to my radio station here and the podcast before I got bored.
      Then the same radio show came on twice so I had to turn it off, the issue isn't with content even though it is a concern. It is with coverage and reception, both are work well. 
      Especially driving through Hertfordshire country lanes and windy roads.</p>

      <h3>The Pi Verse</h3>        
      <h4>How much computer power do you actually need?</h4>
      <p>Everything I am currently doing is now existing in the Raspberry Pi domain or Pi-Verse as I have now coined. I was toying with the idea or buying the domain but then what do I do with it?
         I have enough names that could fit at it would be yet another purchase. When this could just sit nicely inside the Dead House universe and be a subsidary of that.
      The Pi 400 is used for coding, video editing and possibly blogging. The Pi 4 is used for audio editing and as a main computer, the Pi 3b+ (42) is my audio recorder, 
        the Pi 3b is my Deep Web Server and the screen Pi doesn't have a use yet. I have two zeros, one is mixer and the other an audio recorder. The pico will become a volume control.</p>

      <h3>Broadcasting</h3>        
      <h4>Live Internet Show</h4>
      <p>I have been trying to do this for a long time, today I managed to install BUTT on the pi 4 and broadcast here on ths page. Previously, I had only been able to do it on the Mac,
      and then recently on my spare linux machine. This evening I performed a quick test with a mixer, a usb mic and a phone playing music and it all worked. Here we go full steam ahead for another show.</p>
